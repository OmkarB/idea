#Go Resources
All of the Set resources are also available to ventures in Go.

##Venture feature
To be featured on IDEA’s website, please have your Go stage venture provide us with their logo and website information. Send to [idea@neu.edu](idea@neu.edu).
The reason we only feature Go ventures is because that is the stage a company typically has a consistent brand and web presence. 

##Gap Fund
The IDEA Gap Fund is a $10,000 non-equity educational grant available to ventures in the Go stage of the process. Ventures can apply by submitting their business plan and gap request on the 15th of every odd month. Each business plan will be reviewed by IDEA’s student Investment Committee and selections will be made to pitch in front of members of IDEA's Advisory Board.
