#Set Resources

##Business Model Guide
The Objective of the Set stage in IDEA is to take a product or service and commercialize it. To do this ventures will need to create a process that is designed to generate revenue either directly from customers or from other sources like partnerships or advertisements. 
To help ventures develop in the Set stage coaches should familiarize themselves with the [Business Model Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E-IYyc3LAZ03tlZICg-HyFxPOH2zjpbj4nIt4SxpS34/edit). 


###In-kind Service Providers
IDEA works closely with a group of local firms to provide in-kind services to ventures. Our network of service providers expands over a number of industries, including finance, law, marketing, public relations, and technology.

Before requesting legal help you should first have your ventures reach out to IDEA’s legal officer to schedule a time to meet. Ventures can fill out [this form](https://www.tfaforms.com/390675) to get in touch with the legal officer.
