#Business Model Pitch 
A 30-minute pitch to present the work done in the Set stage including the venture’s business model and go-to-market strategy that includes resources and development needs and costs. A venture is prepared to pitch when they have:

Worked on product development
* A revenue model
* A clear and comprehensive go-to-market strategy
* A plan for production, distribution and implementation
* Conducted further customer interviews

Once your venture has worked through the business modeling guide and reviewed the findings with you, arrange a Business Model pitch with the IDEA Staff by emailing Evan Sutherland. He will work to find a time that works for everyone within the next two weeks. Attending the pitch with your venture is strongly encouraged, it’s both an opportunity to learn and facilitate feedback with your venture. Following the pitch, you will either a) pass into the Go Stage or b) be given detailed feedback and questions to answer in order to pass after an additional Business Model pitch.
