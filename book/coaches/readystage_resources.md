#Ready Resources

###Coaching Office hours
As ventures work through the Ready Stage IDEA has Coaching Office Hours on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings from 7:00 - 9:00 in the Lab. This is a time for the venture to discuss their concept, receive feedback and get help on developing through the ready stage. 
Ventures sign up for a time slot to attend [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g9vvUO5zrPhVpVsgQ81EfLMCzvTcEx3MKpvbRz3Fm7Q/edit#gid=108785190).

Here is what you should be looking for at office hours:
1. At the venture’s first visit, review the Value Proposition and talk through what the problem this entrepreneur is out to solve. After you have a clear understanding of what they are working on begin discussing customer interviews 
2. At their second visit discuss the results of their customer interviews. Ask the venture about the feedback they received from potential customers, be sure they followed the advice of the guide. Begin talking through the design of their solution, if you feel like they have concrete answers to all your questions and are on the right track encourage them to request a [coach](https://www.tfaforms.com/389017).
3. If a venture is not ready to move on encourage them to develop their customer validation and attend office hours until the coaching team believes they have done an adequate job validating their concept.
