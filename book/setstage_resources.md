##Solution Design Pitch 

A 30-minute pitch to present the work done in the Ready stage including the value proposition, product validation, competitive analysis, and market research. A venture is prepared to pitch when they have:

* A clear value proposition
* Completed thorough customer interviews
* Have a sense of initial product design
* Preliminary competitive analysis
* Market research around their target market

When you feel like your venture is ready, arrange a pitch with the IDEA Staff email Evan Sutherland. He will work to find a time that works for everyone within the next two weeks. Attending the pitch with your venture is strongly encouraged, itâ€™s both an opportunity to learn and facilitate feedback with your venture. Following the pitch, your venture will either a) pass into the Set Stage or b) be given detailed feedback and questions to answer in order to pass after an additional Solution Design pitch.  Either way be sure to work through the feedback with them.
